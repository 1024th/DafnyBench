Each program in this list represents one way the formal specification and docstring at the top of the .dfy file can be satisfied in Dafny. We note that sometimes there is more than way to implement a program satisfying the same docstring and formal spec. We denote such equivalences using the `_variantX` naming convention. For example, `HasCloseElements_variant01.dfy` is another way to solve `HasCloseElements.dfy`.
